Three engineers from the xAI Grok Bot team built and launched a product from an empty repo in 72 hours, live on stream, using their own agent platform: [Roshan Sadanani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roshansadanani) (product), [Lauren Tan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurenelizabethtan) (engineering, author of PStack), and [Matt Palmer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-palmer) (developer experience). This repo is what I pulled out of those three days: a designed guide, rules you can drop into your own agents, nine role playbooks, a catalogue of bot roles, and a log of everything that broke.

## What's here

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `AGENTS.md` | House rules for a coding agent. Put it in your repo root and your agent reads it. |
| `ANTIPATTERNS.md` | Forty things that broke on air. Each one: what broke, why, and the rule that came out of it. |
| `agents/` | The longer references `AGENTS.md` points at: verification, orchestration, skills and routines, prompts. |
| `roster/` | Sixty-nine agent roles, one file each. What the role owns, what it doesn't, where it gets its facts, what needs approval, and a description you can paste. |
| `playbooks/` | Nine role workshops: engineering, PM, founders, sales engineering, sales, SDR, support, post-sales, marketing. Each has the team of bots, the workflow as it ran, the prompts, the routines and the numbers. |
| `guide/` | [*Grok Bot Guide by SpaceX Engineers*](guide/grok-bot-guide-by-spacex-engineers.pdf), a 24-page PDF that tells the three days as a story: mental model, software factory, case study, failure log, economics. |
| `reference/` | Two short files: `ECONOMICS.md`, every cost and metric quoted with the rule it supports; `PRODUCT.md`, the parts of Grok Bot that change how you design a bot: memory, what transfers on duplicate and share, isolation, permissions. |
| `notes/` | Structured notes, one per day. Product facts, workflows, prompts, failures, numbers, who was who. Everything else was built from these. |

## Where to start

- You want rules for your agent now: copy `AGENTS.md` into your repo root.
- Your agents keep asking you to test their work: `agents/VERIFICATION.md`.
- You are designing a team of agents rather than prompting one: `agents/ORCHESTRATION.md`.
- You want the wording that worked: `agents/PROMPTS.md`.
- You want a bot's job description to paste: `roster/`, starting with `roster/README.md`.
- You want a setup for your own role, say support or sales: `playbooks/`, starting with `playbooks/README.md`.
- You want to know what goes wrong: `ANTIPATTERNS.md`.
- You want to know what it costs and where the tokens go: `reference/ECONOMICS.md`.
- You are deciding what goes in memory versus the description: `reference/PRODUCT.md`.
- You want the whole story: [the PDF guide](guide/grok-bot-guide-by-spacex-engineers.pdf).
- You want to check a claim: `notes/`.

## The factory, in one picture

![The software factory](guide/factory/software-factory.gif)

You talk to one bot. It splits the plan and hands small PRs to implementers. A verifier runs each one and attaches a video, a playtester plays it end to end, and anything that isn't a migration, a deploy or money merges on its own. User reports get reproduced before anyone fixes them. `agents/ORCHESTRATION.md` walks through it; the editable source is in `guide/factory/`.

## In one paragraph

Give each agent one narrow job and a name. Build a verification loop before you build the second agent.

Make the agent reproduce a bug before it fixes one, and attach proof to everything. When it's wrong, write down the general principle, never the specific story.

Audit your routines weekly, because frequency is where the money goes. Keep a human gate on migrations, deploys, money and permissions, no matter how well the loop has been working.
